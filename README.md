# OutdatedBrowsers
Joomla Plugin integration with http://outdatedbrowser.com/

This Joomla plugins add the ability to show a (multilingual) message to the users that visit a Joomla website with an outdated browser.
The definition of "outdated" can be selected from the configuration.
This is done through the excellent project OutdatedBrowser (http://outdatedbrowser.com). Kudos!
